## So why is Russia-Ukraine a big deal in China?

Besides the general interests in war and hot topics, Russia-Ukraine is a (very) big deal in China (aka. the mainland/Beijing) because the situation is a parallel to mainland-Taiwan. They are not exactly the same issue but can be considered the same for all practical purposes. Russia and Ukraine have strong historical ties, so do mainland and Taiwan. Russia wants to reunify with Ukraine, so does the mainland want to unify with Taiwan.

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has brought upon itself unprecedented opinion war and trade sanctions. The same is to be expected against the mainland (if not much more) if the mainland invades Taiwan. Chinese people are carefully observing the situation and gauging the degree the West reacts to a similar scenario they are preparing for. The current event provides invaluable data for China to determine whether a military operation taking over Taiwan is worth it.

## Why do many Chinese people hope Russia win?

If Russia wins the war against Ukraine, it is a symbol of "successfully standing up against Western aggression". This aligns with a rising faction of idelogy in China that seeks to become more isolationist and develop China's own empire, even if it means becoming hostile and decoupling with the West. This faction has gained much popularity in recent years due to China's rising economic and military power, as well as the perception that the West is trying to impose a new round of colonialism on China via further neoliberalization of the mainland's economy.

There are also realistic consequences if Russia wins. If Russia manages to annex Ukraine, Russia will become a much stronger nation. From the Chinese perspective, this helps by diverting Western attention away from the Indo-pacific region and allows China breathing room for its own expansion and development.

In case Russia loses, the Chinese concern is that Russia will become a puppet state of the West. This is unlikely because Russia has nuclear weapons, but possible (say a coup overthrows Putin's rule, purges current elites, and fills the government with pro-West bureaucrats). Then China will have to worry about national security not just in the Pacific direction, but also from the Mid-Asia and Siberian regions. Many privileges and safety assumptions China enjoys right now (e.g., Russian energy sources) will also collapse.

## Key takeaways

* The Russia-Ukraine war is a parallel to the possible mainland-Taiwan war.

* Ensuring Russian success/friendliness (or at least neutrality) is crucial to Chinese economic and national security interests.
